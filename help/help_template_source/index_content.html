				<h1>Using map folders</h1>
				<p>You can use map folders to organize your markers into different sections. Things you can do with folders:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>create a folder</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit a folder</li>
					<li>&lrm;marker templates: custom fields</li>
					<li>&lrm;mass assign color</li>
					<li>&lrm;mass assign custom fields</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Create a folder</h2>
				<p>To create a folder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>open the sidebar</li>
					<li>&lrm;click "Add folder"</li>
					<li>&lrm;enter the desired folder information</li>
					<li>&lrm;click ok to save the new folder</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Edit a folder</h2>
				<p>To edit a folder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>open the sidebar</li>
					<li>&lrm;long press on the folder you wish to edit</li>
					<li>&lrm;modify the folder to your liking</li>
					<li>&lrm;click ok to save the changes</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Marker templates: custom fields</h2>
				<p>While creating or editing a folder, you can define custom fields into the folder. Those folder custom fields will act
					as a template: when creating a new marker with only one folder selected, if that folder has custom fields then the folder's
					custom fields will automatically be added to the newly created marker.</p>
				<p>To create a folder's custom fields from the folder create/edit page:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>click "more options"</li>
					<li>&lrm;select "add custom field"</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit the custom field to your liking and save it</li>
				</ol>
				<p>To edit a folder's custom fields from the folder create/edit page:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>click on the custom field from the custom fields list</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit the custom field to your liking and save it</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Mass assign color and custom fields</h2>
				<p>When changing a folder&rsquo;s color or custom fields, a prompt will offer you to mass-assign the color or custom fields
					to the markers inside that folder.</p>

				<h2>Presets, templates and bulk icons with folders</h2>
				<p>If you want markers to be automatically created with a specific combination of icon, color and custom fields you can
					achieve this through folders. Folders will act as templates for their children markers. To do this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a folder</li>
					<li>Choose the icon, color and custom fields that you would like to see by default for new markers</li>
					<li>Save the folder</li>
					<li>Double click on the folder from the main menu to select only that folder</li>
					<li>And any new marker that you create will inherit its parent folder&rsquo;s attributes</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Why is Map Marker not a navigation app?</h2>
				<p>Navigation apps are complex and hard to get right, and there are already a lot of good navigation apps out there. I believe
					that as a single developer, the way I can provide most value with Map Marker is by focusing on the ability to organize
					your places, and have an easy way to start navigation into navigation-focused apps. Map Marker&rsquo;s focus is different
					from navigation.</p>

				<h2>How do I add locations on Google Maps?</h2>
				<p>Map Marker does not provide such features. Instead, try using one of those links:</p>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>A place in Google Maps has wrong/inaccurate data, how do I fix it?</h2>
				<p>Map Marker does not interact with Google Maps data, instead, try using the Google platform:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>go on Google Maps from a desktop computer: </li>
					<li>click the location that needs fixing</li>
					<li>click "suggest an edit"</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="devices_android">How to install the old map marker app</h2>
				<p>
					If you need to switch back to the old Map Marker V2, you can install it from the APK file available here: <a href="https://github.com/androidseb/mapmarker/releases/tag/map_marker_v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/androidseb/mapmarker/releases/tag/map_marker_v2</a>.
					<br>
					Note: if you updated from Map Marker V2 to Map Marker V3 without uninstalling the app, re-installing the app like this over Map Marker V3 will switch you back to the old Map Marker V2 without losing your user data. However any data created from the V3 app will not be accessible from the newly installed V2 app.
				</p>

				<h2>Where can I find the help center for Map Marker V2?</h2>
				<p>
					If you are using the legacy Map Marker V2 app version, you can find the help center archive <a href="../help_old_v2/index.html">here</a>.

				<h1>Troubleshooting and known problems</h1>

				<h2>Cloud sync error: 404 file not found</h2>
				<p>
					When performing cloud sync, this error can occur if some remote cloud files have been deleted.<br>
					This can happen if you (or one of your collaborators if you're sharing access) have deleted the cloud files from your cloud storage account.<br>
					When this error happens, you can no longer sync to the cloud map and it also probably means that the only copy of your data is on your device, since the cloud data is gone.<br>
					The recommended way to proceed in case you encounter this error is the following:
					<ol>
						<li>Export your markers as a KMZ file</li>
						<li>To minimize the risks of losing the data, create a copy of that exported file somewhere like a secondary device, or a cloud storage account</li>
						<li>By default, Map Marker creates a dedicated folder in your cloud storage account called "Map Marker Places Organizer": identify the source of the cloud data deletion so that it doesn't happen again, for example, if one of your collaborators deleted some file accidentally (e.g. "accidental cleanup"), explain them why not deleting these files is important</li>
						<li>Create a new cloud map</li>
						<li>Import the data from the KMZ file</li>
						<li>Sync your cloud map</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h2 class="devices_android">GPS location inaccurate</h2>
				<p>
					On some Android devices, it can happen that the GPS location becomes inaccurate over time. In some cases,
					it's even possible to see a correct accurate location in one app and a completely inaccurate location in another app.
					This is due to the way location tracking works at the system level and can sometimes be resolved by restarting your device.
					Note that only restarting your device can be insufficient, as some components like the GPS chip might not have been fully powered off in the process.
					The following steps can often work to resolve the issue:<br>
					<ol>
						<li>Power off your device completely</li>
						<li>Wait for 10 seconds</li>
						<li>Power your device back on</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2 class="devices_android">Problems with Google My Maps</h2>
				<p>Google My Maps cannot import the KML/KMZ files produced by Map Marker if they contain the default folder, because it
					cannot handle an empty folder name. To work around this, you will need to import only one folder at a time, that is
					not the default folder.</p>

				<h2 class="devices_android">Premium troubleshooting</h2>
				<p>When you purchase the premium, it becomes available for life for your Google account. The Google account granted with
					the premium access is the one used to perform the purchase. Upon purchasing the premium, you will receive a confirmation
					email with an order number. From then on, you can use the premium on as many devices as you want. However you will need
					to use the exact same Google account to perform the installation of Map Marker on your other device.</p>
				<p>If you cannot use the premium:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Backup your markers outside of the app</li>
					<li>Un-install the app</li>
					<li>&lrm;Open the Google play app</li>
					<li>Make sure you are signed in with your Google account owning the premium in the left drawer of the Google Play app</li>
					<li>Download and install Map Marker again</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If these steps don't work you can send me your order number for confirmation and I will help you.</p>


				<h2 class="devices_android">Problems with Google Play Services</h2>
				<p>
					Some problems with the Google Play Services app can cause various issues with Google-related services.<br>
					Sometimes, you can fix this by clearing the Google Play Services app data:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the system settings</li>
					<li>Applications</li>
					<li>Google Play Services</li>
					<li>Storage</li>
					<li>CLEAR STORAGE</li>
					<li>CLEAR ALL DATA</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="devices_android">Problems with map display: blank map</h2>
				<p>
					Some problems with the Google Maps component can prevent the map display from loading properly, resulting in an empty blank map.<br>
					Sometimes you can fix this by <a href="#devices_android_Problems_with_Google_Play_Services">clearing the Google Play Services app data</a>.<br>
					Unfortunaltey sometimes this will not be enough and you will need to clear the app data completely to resolve the issue.
					Since clearing the app data will result in all your markers being deleted, you have to careful follow these steps to avoid losing your data:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Export your markers as a KMZ file</li>
					<li>Copy the KMZ file to an other device</li>
					<li>Confirm you can import back your markers from the KMZ file</li>
					<li><b>Keep the KMZ file in a safe location</b></li>
					<li><b>ONLY after your markers data is secured</b>, proceed with next steps</li>
					<li>Turn on the problematic device</li>
					<li>Open the system settings</li>
					<li>Applications</li>
					<li>Map Marker</li>
					<li>Storage</li>
					<li>CLEAR STORAGE</li>
					<li>CLEAR ALL DATA</li>
					<li>Restart the app</li>
					<li>Import your markers back from the KMZ file</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="devices_android">Problems with blocked internet access</h2>
				<p>
					In some cases, even though your device has correct internet access, the system can block internet access to Map Marker,
					preventing the app from accessing internet, and preventing sync and causing the map not to load.
					This can be caused by battery savers and/or incorrect system parameters.
					If that happens, you can try the following steps to troubleshoot:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check for any power-saving / network blocking apps and ensure that Map Marker is allowed to use the network</li>
					<li>If that doesn't work, reset your network settings:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Open the system settings</li>
						<li>Navigate to network settings</li>
						<li>Select "Reset network settings"</li>
						<li>Restart your device</li>
					</ol>
					<li>If that doesn't work, back-up your data and re-install the app:</li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="#devices_android_How_to_exportshare_your_markers">Export your markers</a></li>
						<li><a href="#devices_android_How_to_exportshare_your_markers">Import your markers</a> back to another device to confirm that the backup worked</li>
						<li>Once you're confident your data is safely backed-up, uninstall the app</li>
						<li>Restart your device</li>
						<li>Install the app again</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>


				<h2 class="devices_web">Various browser issues</h2>
				<p>
					Right now, the only officially supported browser is Google Chrome.
					The app is built with best effort support for other browsers as well without any guarantee.
				</p>
				<h2 class="devices_web">Images not displaying (white squares instead)</h2>
				<p>
					This can happen if your browser has a setting of blocking third-party content.
					Since images are coming from Google Drive (drive.google.com) instead of mapmarker.app, the browser with third party content blocked might block this, resulting in images displayed as white squares.
					To fix this on Google Chrome, go to the browser settings and change the settings under "Cookies and other site data" to allow third party cookies on mapmarker.app.
