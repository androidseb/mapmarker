    <h1>Map Marker privacy policy</h1>
    <h2>What this policy applies to</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to all 3 versions of the Map Marker app: the Android app, the iOS app and the web
        app.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction of this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy explains how Map Marker can access, use, store, or share your personal data. In short, Map
        Marker never accesses, uses or stores your personal data outside of your device or your cloud account. Some
        sharing features of Map Marker allow you to explicitly share some data outside of your device or cloud account,
        but except that explicit manual sharing process initiated by yourself, Map Marker never shares your data outside
        of your device or cloud account.
    </p>
    <h2>Definition of personal data</h2>
    <p>
        The personal data collected by Map Marker falls under 3 categories:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>User geographic data:</b> the list of geographic objects you can enter into the app which can contain
                geographic coordinates as well as a title, a description, a phone number, a color and associated images
                or media.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>User cloud account data:</b> when explicitly granted access by you, Map Marker can have access to the
                your cloud account data, such as your email address, Google Drive files, or Dropbox files.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>User search queries:</b> the search queries entered by you when searching for places with a third
                party search engine.
            </li>
        </ol>
        This privacy policy page will focus on <b>user geographic data</b> and <b>user cloud account data</b> only. When
        using the third party places search engines in Map Marker, depending on the search source you're using, you will
        need to refer to different privacy policies:
        <ul>
            <li>Here Search API: <a href="https://legal.here.com/en-gb/privacy">https://legal.here.com/en-gb/privacy</a>
            </li>
            <li>Google Places Search API: <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Microsoft Bing Places search: <a
                    href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-ca/privacystatement">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-ca/privacystatement</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker accesses your data</h2>
    <p>
        The data is collected by Map Marker when you input the data manually or import the data as files or though other
        apps sharing features into Map Marker. When you grant Map Marker access to your cloud account data, Map Marker
        will use that access by reading from or writing to your cloud account data.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker uses your data</h2>
    <p>
        Map Marker uses the data locally on the device with the different Map Marker features (displaying the markers
        list, displaying markers on the map, etc.). When you grant Map Marker access to your cloud account data, Map
        Marker will use that access to search for existing map files created by you or shared by others with you. When
        syncing map data, Map Marker will use the access to your cloud account data to download it on your device in
        order to be able to display it in the app.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker stores your data</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored by Map Marker locally on the device, or into your cloud account data if you choose to sync
        your data into your cloud account.
    </p>
    <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
    <p>
        Your data lives on the device and on any cloud platform you explicitly configured Map Marker to sync to.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker keeps your data</h2>
    <p>
        The data is kept on the device or on the cloud platforms as long as you don't delete it manually.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker share your data</h2>
    <p>
        Map Marker does not share your data externally unless you perform explicit actions to share or sync your data.
        In the case of you manually sharing data from Map Marker, the exported data could be sent to any app on the
        device you choose to share with. In the case of sync, Map Marker allows you to configure an automated sync with
        some cloud storage platforms: your data is then shared by Map Marker with those cloud storage platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>What cloud storage platforms Map Marker can use</h2>
    <p>
        Currently Google Drive or Dropbox. When you grant access to Map Marker to a cloud platform, that access is used
        solely to read/write geographic synced data between the cloud platform and your device, and for nothing else.
