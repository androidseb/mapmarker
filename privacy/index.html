    </p>
    <h2>Introduction of this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy explains how Map Marker can access, use, store, or share your personal data. In short, Map
        Marker never accesses, uses or stores your personal data outside of your device or your cloud account. Some
        sharing features of Map Marker allow you to explicitly share some data outside of your device or cloud account,
        but except that explicit manual sharing process initiated by yourself, Map Marker never shares your data outside
        of your device or cloud account.
    </p>
    <h2>Definition of personal data</h2>
    <p>
        The personal data collected by Map Marker falls under different categories:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>User geographic data:</b> the list of geographic objects you can enter into the app which can contain
                geographic coordinates that  as well as a title, a description, a phone number, a color and associated images
                or media.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Device location:</b> the location of the user's device, obtained for example through the
                device's GPS module, after the user has granted permission.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>User cloud account data:</b> when explicitly granted access by you, Map Marker can have access to the
                your cloud account data, such as your email address, Google Drive files, or Dropbox files.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>User search queries:</b> the search queries entered by you when searching for places with a third
                party search engine.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This privacy policy page will focus on <b>user geographic data</b>, <b>device location</b> and <b>user cloud account data</b> only. When
        using the third party places search engines in Map Marker, depending on the search source you're using, you will
        need to refer to different privacy policies:
        <ul>
            <li>Here Search API: <a href="https://legal.here.com/en-gb/privacy">https://legal.here.com/en-gb/privacy</a>
            </li>
            <li>Google Places Search API: <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Microsoft Bing Places search: <a
                    href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-ca/privacystatement">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-ca/privacystatement</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker accesses your data</h2>
    <p>
        <b>User geographic data</b> is collected by Map Marker when you input the data manually or import the data as files or though other
        apps sharing features into Map Marker.<br>
        <b>Device location</b> is collected by Map Marker when you grant Map Marker access to your device's
        location - note that while using the 'tracks recording' feature, the location data might be collected even when
        the app is closed or not in use.<br>
        <b>User cloud account data</b> is accessed when you grant Map Marker access and Map Marker
        will use that access by reading from or writing to your cloud account data.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker uses your data</h2>
    <p>
        <b>User geographic data</b> is used locally on the device with the different Map Marker features (displaying the markers
        list, displaying markers on the map, etc.).<br>
        <b>Device location</b> is used exclusively for two purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Display the device's location on the map.
            </li>
            <li>
                Record tracks into the <b>user geographic data</b> when the 'tracks recording' feature is used.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>User cloud account data</b> is used to search for existing map files created by you or shared by others with you. When
        syncing map data, Map Marker will use the access to your cloud account data to download it on your device in
        order to be able to display it in the app.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker stores your data</h2>
    <p>
        <b>User geographic data</b> is stored locally on the device, and into your cloud account data if you choose to sync
        your data into your cloud account.<br>
        <b>Device location</b> is stored into the <b>user geographic data</b> when the 'tracks recording' feature is used.<br>
        <b>User cloud account data</b> is stored in your cloud account and can also be copied locally on the device
        if you choose to sync your data from your cloud account.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
    <p>
        Your data lives on the device and on any cloud platform you explicitly configured Map Marker to sync to.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker keeps your data</h2>
    <p>
        The data is kept on the device or on the cloud platforms as long as you don't delete it manually.
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker share your data</h2>
    <p>
        Map Marker does not share your data externally unless you perform explicit actions to share or sync your data.
        In the case of you manually sharing data from Map Marker, the exported data could be sent to any app on the
        device you choose to share with. In the case of sync, Map Marker allows you to configure an automated sync with
        some cloud storage platforms: your data is then shared by Map Marker with those cloud storage platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>What cloud storage platforms Map Marker can use</h2>
    <p>
        Currently Google Drive or Dropbox. When you grant access to Map Marker to a cloud platform, that access is used
        solely to read/write geographic synced data between the cloud platform and your device, and for nothing else.
