	<h1>Map Marker Roadmap</h1>
	<p>Note: this is my mindset at the moment in an attempt of transparency but it's not a commitment, I might change my mind.</p>
	<h2>Currently working on...</h2>
		<li>
			Map Marker V3 update - On Jan 31 2023, the Map Marker V3 update, built from the ground up was released - taking some time to watch for any potential issues and fix things quickly if users report any problems.
		</li>
	<h3>Next ideas</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Track recording: recording the device location over time as one POI entry</li>
		<li>Quick actions: ability to modify a marker and its custom fields without entering the edit page</li>
		<li>Bulk addess import: street addresses / postal code import without lat/lng information</li>
		<li>Route planning: optimal route calculation + starting navigation with multiple markers</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other good ideas</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>KMZ web images import: downloading web images from a third-party KMZ while importing it</li>
		<li>better offline maps</li>
		<li>quick picture mode (setting to open directly camera, or gallery, or camera internally)</li>
		<li>pictures annotations (shapes, arrow, text, etc.)</li>
		<li>print marker to PDF, with map, snapshot, title, description, etc.</li>
		<li>snackbar for cancelling marker deletion</li>
		<li>new marker title/description pre-fill parameters: address, date, time, number, folder name, arbitrary string</li>
		<li>voice notes</li>
		<li>left handed mode (showing the action buttons at the left)</li>
		<li>more actions based on multiple markers selection (send phone, send email, etc.)</li>
		<li>SMS mass sending with number in selected markers</li>
		<li>Improvements to search</li>
		<ul>
			<li>have different sort options (once more fields are added to markers: title, description, creation date, any other date, distance to current location, distance to specific marker, etc.)</li>
			<li>advanced search filter to search pois by different fields (title, description, custom field, etc.)</li>
			<li>search filter to filter displayed markers on the map</li>
			<li>renaming search result before adding to the map</li>
			<li>tags for markers with search by tag</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Export all images of a marker</li>
		<li>Read out marker info (voice synth) on marker select</li>
		<li>Bluetooth sharing with Garmin or TomTom GPS devices</li>
		<li>Android Widget and/or lockscreen shortcut to mark current location</li>
		<li>Alarm when nearing a POI</li>
		<li>Make map snapshots larger than the screen</li>
		<li>Auto address filling in marker creation</li>
		<li>Altitude lookup for markers</li>
		<li>Temperature lookup for markers</li>
		<li>GPX import/export</li>
		<li>UTM import/export</li>
		<li>Pictures import from geotag: import markers from pictures location data</li>
		<li>Smarter camera re-positioning when switching map file</li>
		<li>Start navigation between 2 points, not from current location</li>
		<li>Add a calendar reminder for a marker, with Google calendar integration</li>
		<li>Proximity alert: display a notification when nearing a given marker</li>
		<li>Attaching any file type to a marker, not only images</li>
		<li>Keep unsaved edits for next app launch: currently unsaved edits are lost when exiting the app without saving</li>
		<li>Ability to draw lines and polygons, rather than dragging the map</li>
		<li>Organizer "select markers" UX improvements: allow selecting markers by drawing a polygon</li>
		<li>Additional custom field types:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Star rating custom field</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
