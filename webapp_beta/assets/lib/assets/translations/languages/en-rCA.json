I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.\n\nIf you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:\n- talk about the app to people around you\n- rate the app to recommend it on the store\n- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)\n\nIf you do not like the app, please e-mail me (from the \"about\" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single e-mail, so don't be shy!\n\nAnd finally, thank you for reading this :-)\n\nRegards\nSébastien",
