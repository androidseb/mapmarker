	<h1>Map Marker V3 update (coming soon)</h1>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		The Map Marker V3 update ships to Android, iOS and Web.
		For all users of Map Marker V3, it will remain possible to import a Map Marker V2 cloud map using Google Drive or Dropbox.
		Map Marker V2 will no longer be maintained or supported, but users are free to keep using it while it still works.

	<h2>Special note for beta testers</h2>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		If you're currently using Map Marker V3 while it is in beta, thank you for your help!
		Since V3 is a full app rewrite, you might come across unexpected issues.
		If you do find issues, please report them to me, I often fix them very quickly, and it will benefit all other users too.
		If you don't have time for testing and wish to get out of beta you can do so:
		• from the Play Store page of the app on Android
		• by uninstalling the Testflight app on iOS
		Keep in mind V3 will eventually be released to everyone (when it has reached quality requirements), so if you wish to stay on V2, you can read through the section below, titled "For users who wish to remain on Map Marker V2".


	</p>
	<h2>For users who wish to remain on Map Marker V2</h2>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		To get more information about options to keep using Map Marker V2, see details <a href="https://github.com/androidseb/mapmarker/releases/tag/map_marker_v2">here</a>..


	</p>
	<h2>Map Marker V3 improvements</h2>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		Map Marker V3 will have many improvements such as:

		• Much faster app start time
		• Smart markers display: limit the number of markers visible at a given time
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regardless of the number of markers the map view should remain smooth
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You can now have thousands of markers in your map without slowdowns
		• Almost all features from Android (except offline maps) are now available on iOS and web:
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Dropbox cloud sync
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Floating titles
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Sub-folders
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Custom folder colors
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Image quality settings
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Share map snapshot
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Manage map files
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Jump to coordinates
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Delete duplicates
		• No longer depending on Google Play Services to work (easier to run on alternative Android distributions)
		• Cloud sync no longer blocks the app with a loading screen, it is performed in the background while using the app
		• Reduced problems with large files on the Web version
		• Overall better performance and usability
		• More efficient app development, so more frequent features in the future, on all platforms

	</p>
