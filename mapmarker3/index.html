	<h1>Map Marker V3 update</h1>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		The Map Marker V3 update is coming soon!
		When released, the update will ship to Android and iOS devices and will also replace the current Map Marker web app.
		Users who wish to avoid the update are free to disable store updates for Map Marker on their system.
		For <b>Android</b> users who upgraded from Map Marker V2 to V3, there will also be a way to switch back to Map Marker V2 without losing the app data.
		For <b>iOS</b> users who upgraded from Map Marker V2 to V3, <b>there will be no way to switch back</b> to Map Marker V2 since you cannot side-load iOS apps.
		For all users of Map Marker V3, it will remain possible to import a Map Marker V2 cloud map using Google Drive.
		Map Marker V2 will no longer be maintained or supported, but users are free to keep using it while it still works.


	</p>
	<h2>Map Marker V3 improvements</h2>
	<p style="white-space: pre-line">
		Map Marker V3 will have many improvements such as:

		• Much faster app start time
		• Better handling of large data sets: can now handle thousands of markers without slowdowns
		• Bridging feature gaps between platforms (e.g. hello floating titles for iOS and Web!)
		• No longer depending on Google Play Services to work (easier to run on alternative Android distributions)
		• More consistent cloud sync options between platforms (hello Dropbox on iOS and Web!)
		• Cloud sync no longer blocks the app with a loading screen, it is performed in the background while using the app
		• Reduced problems with large files on the Web version
		• Overall better performance and usability
		• More efficient app development, so more frequent features in the future, on all platforms

	</p>
	<h2>Release schedule (tentative)</h2>
